# leaflet-challenge
This repository contains an index.html file setting up a webpage displaying a geoJSON dataset containing earthquake data within the continental US from the last 7 days (as of 6/20/22). The logic.js file uses d3 and leaflet to sort through the data and create custom circle markers of varying colors and sizes based on the depth and magnitude of the earthquake respectively. Each marker has a popup displaying additional information about each earthquake. A legend is included to show what the colors of the circles represent.
